👋  Hi, I’m Fadila :)

👀  I’m interested in anything software engineering, playing around with code, backend development, software architecture and leadership within tech teams. 

🌱  I currently work as a full stack software engineer. Technologies I use include C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, React + Redux, GraphQL, SQL and ElasticSearch.

🍞  I love to bake! [Here are some of the things I've baked](https://www.instagram.com/matchadou/).

🎨  I also paint! [Here are some of my paintings](https://www.instagram.com/dilajournals/).
