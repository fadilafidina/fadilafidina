👋  

Hi, I’m @fadilafidina

👀  

I’m interested in anything software engineering, playing around with code, backend development, software architecture and leadership within tech teams. 

🌱  

I’m currently learning React and Javascript, although I do a lot of .NET Core development and have played around with AWS.

💞️  

I’m looking to collaborate on anything that's going to challenge me and let me learn new technologies.

🍞  

I also love to bake - find me on instagram as (@matchadou)[https://www.instagram.com/matchadou/].
